# Weights & Biases Registry Demo

This project demonstrates how to:

- Train and log a model as a [W&B Artifact](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/)
- Link that artifact to a [W&B Registry](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/core/registry) collection
- Assign version aliases like `production` and `latest-candidate`
- Consume a model from the registry in downstream code or notebooks
